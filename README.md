# AAU Cykeldata

This reposity contains Python and SQL scripts for creating a Postgresql-database with data from OpenStreetMap, with a focus on cycling infrastructure.

The repository has been developed by [Aalborg University, Institute for Planning](https://www.plan.aau.dk/).
Thanks to [People for Bikes](https://peopleforbikes.org/) for initial inspiration for how to work with OSM-data.

## Usage
The repository contains to methods for loading OSM data to the database: The Python module osmnx and the command line tool osm2pgsql.
Using osm2pgsql is recommended, since it results in richer data (including for example relations).
If osmnx is used, use the files *download_osm_data.py* and *prep_classify_osmn.py*. 
If osm2pgsql is used (see *loading_osm.sql*) the scripts *prep_osm_data_osm2pgsql.py* and *classify_osm2pgsql.py* must be used.

Update info in config with the necessary info about database, name of study area etc.

It is assumed that a postgresql database has been created with the necessary extensions (see loading_osm.sql).
A number of Python modules such as geopandas, sqlalchemy, psycopg2 must be installed before use.
